# Google Sheets Authentication Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Google Sheets integration for user authentication and balance management in your Chase banking app.

## üìã Prerequisites

- A Google account
- Access to Google Cloud Console
- A Google Sheet with user data

## üîß Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create Your Google Sheet

1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
2. Create a new spreadsheet
3. Set up your sheet with the following structure:

| Column A | Column B | Column C | Column D |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Username | Password | Balance  | Account Name |
| john123  | pass123  | 5000.00  | John Doe |
| mary456  | mypass   | 2500.50  | Mary Smith |
| admin    | admin123 | 10000.00 | Administrator |

**Important Notes:**
- Row 1 should contain headers
- Username should be unique for each user
- Balance should be a number (no currency symbols)
- Account Name is the display name for the user

### 2. Get Your Google Sheet ID

1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Look at the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[SHEET_ID]/edit`
3. Copy the `SHEET_ID` part (the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`)

Example: If your URL is:
```
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms/edit
```
Your Sheet ID is: `1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms`

### 3. Make Your Sheet Publicly Readable

1. Click the "Share" button in your Google Sheet
2. Click "Change to anyone with the link"
3. Set permission to "Viewer"
4. Click "Done"

**Security Note:** This makes your sheet readable by anyone with the link. For production use, consider setting up proper OAuth authentication.

### 4. Get a Google API Key

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google Sheets API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API"
   - Click on it and press "Enable"
4. Create an API Key:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "API Key"
   - Copy your API key
5. (Recommended) Restrict your API key:
   - Click on your API key to edit it
   - Under "API restrictions", select "Restrict key"
   - Choose "Google Sheets API"
   - Save

### 5. Configure Your Application

1. Open `src/config/googleSheets.js`
2. Replace the placeholder values:

```javascript
export const GOOGLE_SHEETS_CONFIG = {
  // Replace with your actual Google Sheet ID
  SHEET_ID: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_SHEET_ID_HERE',
  
  // Replace with your actual Google API Key
  API_KEY: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE',
  
  // Adjust if your data is in different columns/sheet
  RANGE: 'Sheet1!A:D',
  
  BASE_URL: 'https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets',
};
```

### 6. Test Your Setup

1. Start your React application: `npm start`
2. Go to the login page
3. Try logging in with one of the usernames/passwords from your sheet
4. If successful, you should be redirected to the banking dashboard with the user's balance displayed

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Google Sheets integration is not configured properly"**
   - Check that you've updated both SHEET_ID and API_KEY in the config file
   - Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes

2. **"Failed to fetch user data"**
   - Verify your Google Sheet is publicly readable
   - Check that your API key is correct and has Google Sheets API enabled
   - Ensure your sheet ID is correct

3. **"Invalid username or password"**
   - Check that your sheet has the correct structure (Username in column A, Password in column B)
   - Verify the username/password combination exists in your sheet
   - Make sure there are no extra spaces in your sheet data

4. **CORS errors**
   - This shouldn't happen with Google Sheets API, but if it does, make sure you're using the correct API endpoint

### Testing Your Configuration:

You can test if your Google Sheets API is working by visiting this URL in your browser:
```
https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/YOUR_SHEET_ID/values/Sheet1!A:D?key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_SHEET_ID` and `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual values. You should see your sheet data in JSON format.

## üîí Security Considerations

### For Development:
- The current setup is fine for development and testing
- Your sheet is publicly readable but not writable

### For Production:
Consider implementing:
- OAuth 2.0 authentication instead of API keys
- Server-side authentication to hide API credentials
- Encrypted password storage (currently passwords are stored in plain text)
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization

## üìù Sample Data Format

Here's a sample of how your Google Sheet should look:

```
| Username | Password | Balance | Account Name    |
|----------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| john123  | pass123  | 5000.00 | John Doe        |
| mary456  | mypass   | 2500.50 | Mary Smith      |
| admin    | admin123 | 10000.00| Administrator   |
| demo     | demo     | 1000.00 | Demo User       |
```

## üéØ Features

Once set up, your application will support:

- ‚úÖ User authentication against Google Sheets data
- ‚úÖ Balance display from Google Sheets
- ‚úÖ Error handling for invalid credentials
- ‚úÖ Session management (Remember Me functionality)

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages

4. Ensure all configuration values are correct

Happy banking! üè¶
